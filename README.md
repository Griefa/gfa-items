# gfa-items v1.0.0

+ In desperate need for images for your server? Then you have come to the right place. This repo contains items either created by myself and/or items from other scripts that I have either purchased or got off GitHub.
+ If you can't find an image, create an issue and I'll try and find/create it for you. If you manage to find some items then please feel free to submit a Pull Request so other people can find some use for it.

- If you plan to contribute, please use this temple for items: [Template for Items](https://codepen.io/lilphantom25/pen/RwQEvWL?editors=1000)
    + Please make sure all Images are at least 100 x 100
